# How to Play
Wordle is a game where you guess words in hopes of determining the final solution. After guessing a word, hints are given based on the letters positions in your guess compared to the actual solution. These hints should be used to determine yor next guess.

## Hints
The hints are color coded:
| color | description |
| --- | --- |
| 游릭 | letter is in solution and in correct position |
| 游리 | letter is in solution, but in wrong position |
| 游댮 | letter is not in solution |

## Example

As you can see the final solution is `along`. Let's walk through the example one guess at a time:
- guess #1 = `rates`
    - 游리 - `a` is in solution, but in wrong position
    - 游댮 - `r`,`t`,`e`, and `s` are not in solution
- guess #2 = `ample`
    - 游릭 - `a` is in correct position
    - 游리 - `l` is in solution, but in wrong position
    - 游댮 - `m`,`p`, and `e` are not in solution
- guess #3 = `aloud`
    - 游릭 - `a`, `l`, `o` are in correct positions
    - 游댮 - `u` and `d` are not in solution
- guess #4 = `alone`
    - 游릭 - `a`, `l`, `o`, `n` are in correct positions
    - 游댮 - `e` is not in solution
- guess #5 = `along`
    - 游릭 - `a`, `l`, `o`, `n`, `g` are in correct positions
